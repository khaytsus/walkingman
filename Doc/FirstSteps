JPK06.07.92


   The program makes men displayed by sprites move on the screens.  All
(non-)hires and (non-)interlace screens (except HAM) are allowed, also two
or more screens with different size/depth/density/colors at the same time.
Illegal graphic modes (HAM, new ECS) will confuse the program, but that is
a technical problem (if they disappear everything will be ok).
   It should be runned as a background task via run or runback; it should
be quitted if there is another program making difficult calculations,
because the program needs some time.  In other aspects the program doesn't
collide with multitasking.
   If You call the program it is possible to show how many men should
appear.
   It is funny to look at the men.  Try following things:
	-open different screens.
	-change the colors to dark and to white colors.
	-move screens.
	-change other screen values (depth, size, graphic mode).
